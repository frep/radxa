Precompiled kernels
===================

The boot-images and the according modules found here are extracted from working images.
To unpack an existing image, the `rkunpack` command from the rkflashtool was used.

* The original ubuntu image can be found [here](http://dl.radxa.com/rock_pro/images/ubuntu/nand/radxa_rock_pro_ubuntu_13.09_desktop_141124_nand.zip).
