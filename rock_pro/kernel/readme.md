Precompiled kernels
===================

The boot-images and the according modules found here are extracted from working images.
To unpack an existing image, the `rkunpack` command from the rkflashtool was used.

* The original ubuntu image can be found [here](http://dl.radxa.com/rock_pro/images/ubuntu/nand/radxa_rock_pro_ubuntu_14.04_desktop_fhd_140823_update.zip).
